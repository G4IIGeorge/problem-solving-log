# Problem Solving Log

This repository documents my journey learning how to solve programming problems.
The goal is not just to reach correct solutions, but to improve my thinking,
problem decomposition, and understanding of computer science fundamentals.

I use this log to track my progress, reflect on mistakes, and revisit older
problems as my skills improve.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Build strong problem-solving habits
- Learn how to break problems into smaller steps
- Practice explaining my thinking clearly
- Track my growth over time as a beginner

---

## 🧠 How I Approach Problems

For each problem, I try to document:
1. My understanding of the problem
2. My initial approach or idea
3. The final solution
4. What I learned or found confusing
5. How I could improve the solution in the future

## 📁 Structure

Problems are organized by topic and difficulty
/arrays
/strings
/loops
/recursion
/basic-math
Each problem file includes comments explaining my thought process.

---

## 📝 Example Problem Format

Each problem file typically contains:

- Problem description
- My step-by-step reasoning
- The implemented solution
- Notes about time/space complexity (when applicable)
- Reflections on what I learned

---

## 📈 Progress & Reflections

I occasionally revisit older problems to:
- Refactor solutions
- Improve readability
- Apply better techniques I’ve learned later

This helps me measure real improvement over time.

## 🚀 Why This Repository Exists

I created this repository to focus on learning **how to think like a programmer**,
not just memorizing solutions. It represents my growth as I build foundations
for a future career in computing.
