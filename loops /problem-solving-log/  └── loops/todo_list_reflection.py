"""
Problem:
Build a to-do list that allows a user to:
- View tasks
- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- Exit the program

Constraints:
- Use only Python fundamentals
- Use a loop for the menu
- Store tasks in a list

Approach:
- Use a while True loop to keep the program running
- Store tasks in a list called 'tasks'
- Use if/elif statements to handle menu choices
- Use enumerate() to display tasks with numbers

Challenges:
- Forgot to define the tasks list before the loop
- Mixed up 'task' and 'tasks', causing a NameError
- Misplaced an else block due to indentation

What I Learned:
- Variables must be defined before they are used
- Indentation controls program logic in Python
- Loops are useful for menu-based programs
- Lists are good for storing dynamic data

Improvements for the Future:
- Save tasks to a file so they persist
- Add input validation to prevent crashes
- Refactor repeated code into functions
